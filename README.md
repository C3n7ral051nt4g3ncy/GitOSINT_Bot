# Why use a Discord Bot 🦾

Using command line OSINT Tools on a computer requires the opening of numerous scripts.
Same on a phone if you are doing OSINT "On-the-Go" by using Termux which can be demanding.

**GitOSINT Bot (Purrlock Holmes) consolidates many tools into one**, eliminating the need to individually open scripts. This means that individuals can conveniently conduct OSINT investigations right from their Discord on their phones. Many CTF teams already dedicate countless hours on Discord discussing findings and communicating. The Bot can be a big help. 

By adding this BOT to your server, you'll save valuable time. No more manual searches or launching python scripts. Simply initiate a search within your server and receive immediate results.

Many CTF teams spend hours on discord sharing their findings and communicating, so inviting the BOT to your server is a time saver, no need to search manually or to open python scripts, just run the search from your own server and get results.
