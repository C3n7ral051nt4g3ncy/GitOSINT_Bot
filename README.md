# GitOSINT Bot 🤖

<br>

> ⚠️ **Update 20th of August 2023**:<br>
> Originally, my intention was to design a Bot solely for my personal use, enhancing my investigative capacities particularly when I'm on the move. Situations where I might be without laptop access or when Termux proves insufficient made the idea of accessing my Discord BOT via smartphone the perfect remedy.

>Believing in the power of community and the spirit of sharing, I opened access to the Bot for everyone, free of charge. The enthusiasm with which GitOSINT was received was [remarkable](https://twitter.com/cyb_detective/status/1692944310856024535).
>In fact, it was integrated into over 100 servers. This led to a verification process by Discord, requiring personal identification on my part. I complied, and am pleased to note that the Bot was verified and acknowledged by Discord's team.

> **However, I've made the decision to discontinue the GITOSINT Bot**. My attention was drawn to certain concerns: <br>
Notably, the Bot being invited to servers which don't align with community standards. **A particular instance being its presence in a server promoting racism.**

<br>

# 🔮 Future Developments 

I will keep working hard on GitOSINT Bot, at the end of 2024/start of 2025, it should be released again to the public, but to a select few.
It's a very powerful tool and I will not put it in the hands of anyone and everyone, so the people who will get access will be vetted OSINT professionnals and intelligence analysts, basically anyone working with OSINT.

There will be a ton of API's in the bot that I pay a lot of money for, I guess you obviously know that API's cost money, and I am not willing to pay for your searches 😼.

I think Open Source code and projects have limitations, and we all need to make money from our hard work at one stage.

Bot : ```𝐏𝐮𝐫𝐫𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐤𝐇𝐨𝐥𝐦𝐞𝐬 🐾#0607```
<br>
Handler: ```𝙲.𝟶.𝟺#1860```

# Why use a Discord Bot 🦾

Using command line OSINT Tools on a computer requires the opening of numerous scripts.
Same on a phone if you are doing OSINT "On-the-Go" by using Termux which can be demanding.

**GitOSINT Bot (Purrlock Holmes) consolidates many tools into one**, eliminating the need to individually open scripts. This means that individuals can conveniently conduct OSINT investigations right from their Discord on their phones. Many CTF teams already dedicate countless hours on Discord discussing findings and communicating. The Bot can be a big help. 

By adding this BOT to your server, you'll save valuable time. No more manual searches or launching python scripts. Simply initiate a search within your server and receive immediate results.

Many CTF teams spend hours on discord sharing their findings and communicating, so inviting the BOT to your server is a time saver, no need to search manually or to open python scripts, just run the search from your own server and get results.
